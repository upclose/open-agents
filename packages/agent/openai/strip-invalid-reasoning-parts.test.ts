I need to respond to the user saying "hi." I already answered their previous question about the project, mentioning that the workspace is empty except for the .git folder.

It looks like the user is asking for a summary of the project again, so I should mention that the project currently has an empty repository. Since I already have context, I don't necessarily need a tool—just a concise answer should do! I'll note that the repo currently only contains the .git folder, with no source files or manifest.

- no source files
- no README
- no package.json
- no AGENTS.md

So at the moment, there isn’t an actual app or codebase here to describe. It looks like an initialized git repo without project files checked out.

- inspect the git history/branches to see what should be here, or

I need to respond to the user asking if I'm sure about something. It's important to verify. I think we should use some tools to inspect for hidden files or check the git status of branches. I could approach this with maybe three steps, though it's a simple task and might not need that much. I'll definitely avoid using cat for file reading. Instead, I'll focus on git commands like git status, git branch, and git ls.`,
